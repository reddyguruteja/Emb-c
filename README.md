# INTRODUCTION TO Smoke Level Detector with Alarm

          The fire accidents are the biggest problems, that’s increased day to day, which is damaged our property and puts man’s life in danger. So, Smoke Detector Systems are very useful in detecting smoke or fire in buildings, offices, banks, schools, and other Personal Properties. Which can save human life and save properties from fire accidents. In this project, we will make a low-cost Smoke Detector System Using MQ2 Gas Sensor and Arduino. This system or device continuously to measure smoke levels around it and show this level value on a display in the PPM unit. Also, it warns us by generating sound and turn on a light, when the smoke level is increased.
  
          The key components of the Smoke Detector System are MQ2, Arduino board, OLED Display, LEDs, and Buzzer. The MQ2 is one type of gas sensor, which can sense Smoke as well as LPG, Alcohol, and Methane. Arduino board is the main brain of this system that controls the whole system. The MQ2 sensor continuously measures Smoke levels in the air and sends data to the Arduino board. Then Arduino prints the Smoke level value on the OLED display in the PPM unit. The LEDs and Buzzer used as indicators, it indicates the air fresh or smoke presence in the air.
          
# HIGH LEVEL REQUIREMENTS
 1. To detect the smoke.
 2. To find the level of smoke.
 3. Sounds alarm 
 
# LOW LEVEL REQUIREMENTS 
  1. Display the level of smoke

   # Components :
   
   # Arduino UNO
      Arduino UNO is a low-cost, flexible, and easy-to-use programmable open-source microcontroller board that can be integrated into a variety of electronic projects. This board can be interfaced with other Arduino boards, Arduino shields, Raspberry Pi boards and can control relays, LEDs, servos, and motors as an output.
Arduino UNO features AVR microcontroller Atmega328, 6 analogue input pins, and 14 digital I/O pins out of which 6 are used as PWM output.

 # Seeed Grove - Gas sensor(MQ2)
      The Grove - Gas Sensor(MQ2) module is useful for gas leakage detecting(in home and industry). It can detect LPG, i-butane, methane, alcohol, Hydrogen, smoke and so on. Based on its fast response time. measurements can be taken as soon as possible. Also, the sensitivity can be adjusted by the potentiometer.
      
  # Buzzer
     A buzzer or beeper is an audio signaling device, which may be mechanical, electromechanical, or piezoelectric (piezo for short). Typical uses of buzzers and beepers include alarm devices, timers, and confirmation of user input such as a mouse click or keystroke.
     
  # Led generic
       Generic fixtures are fixtures that normally use halogen bulbs as a light source where as LED fixtures use LEDs, due to the fact they use halogen lamps they tend to need a lot more power than LED fixtures and therefore are powered through dimmer packs.
  
  # jumper wires
       Jumper wires are simply wires that have connector pins at each end, allowing them to be used to connect two points to each other without soldering.
       
  # Resisitors
     A resistor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element.
     
  # LCD
          • The term LCD stands for liquid crystal display. It is one kind of electronic display module used in an extensive 
          range of applications like various circuits and devices like mobile phones, calculators, computers, TV sets, etc.
         •These displays are mainly preferred for multi-segment light-emitting diodes and seven segment display.
         
   # Advantages
        * Ability to Detect Fires Faster. One of the main advantages of a smart smoke detector is that it can detect a fire much faster than a traditional one. ...
        * Notifications and Alert Services.
        * Reliability and Battery Life.
        
   # Applications
         * Detecting smoke or fire in buildings
         * offices
         *  banks
         * schools
         *  other Personal Properties
