# Introduction
# ULTRASONIC SOUND SENSOR WITH ATmega328 MICROPROCESSOR
 The project as the name suggests is based on Ultrasonic sensors.Ultrasonic sensors work by sending out a sound wave at a frequency above the range of human hearing. Our ultrasonic sensors, like many others, use a single transducer to send a pulse and to receive the echo. The sensor determines the distance to a target by measuring time lapses between the sending and receiving of the ultrasonic pulse.
 # Requirements:
 # High Level Requirements:
 -> It can send echo to find object
 -> It can able to detect Moving object
 -> Moving object signal will displayed on a display unit
 
 # Low Level Requirements:
 ->  We can find the exact location of an Target
  -> It can find distance of an object
  -> It can find speed of an object
  -> It can display distance of an object
 # Research
 The requirements for the program to run or for the code to be in effect are basic and a great solution for the detection of clear objects.
# SWOT ANALYSIS:-
# a) Strength:
The distance to an obstacle can be measured with the low cost ultrasonic sensor . The sensors can measure distances form 2 to 400cm with an accuracy of 3mm. This sensors module includes ultrasonic transmitter, ultrasonic receiver and control circuit.

# b) Weakness:
Although we fully believe in the capability of our sensors, we understand that ultrasonics are not suited for every application. Focuses of low thickness, similar to froth and fabric, have a tendency to assimilate sound vitality; these materials may be hard to sense at long range.

# c) Opportunity:
This project Can be used as parking assistance systems in vehicles with high power ultrasonic transmitter. This Project Can be used as burglar alarm with suitable additional software for homes and offices.

# d) Threats :
Ultrasonic sensors must view a surface (particularly a hard, level surface) unequivocally (oppositely) to get adequate sound reverberation. Additionally, solid detecting requires a base target surface range, which is indicated for every sensor sort. If connection is wrong there might be chances of short-circuit.

# 4W's an 1H :-
# What:
we have made a setup based on a microcontroller in which real time distance is sensed by an ultrasonic sensor and displays measured distance on an LCD display.

# Where:
It measures accurate distance using a non-contact technology - A technology that involves no physical contact between sensor and object.

# When: In 1959, Satomura created an ultrasonic flowmeter that used doppler technology.

# Why: I am Developing this project for easily measure the distance between objects

# How:
By using Atmega328 an display an ultrasonic sensor mainly used to determine the distance of the target object.

# Advantages:
•The ultrasonic sensor has high sensitivity, high frequency and high penetrating power therefore it can easily detect the external or deep objects.
        •The use of ultrasonic sensor makes this system more accurate and precise than other methods.
        •This system is easy to use, not dangerous during operation for nearby objects, person, equipment or material.
        •Radar systems have a number of defense as well as civil applications.
        
 # Applications:
       •It is used in machines like Automotive parking sensor obstacle warning systems,industrial distance measurements, terrain monitoring robots.
       •RADAR speed meters are used by the traffic police for enforcing speed limit.
       •Marine RADARs used to locate the landmarks and other ships.
       •Air traffic control uses radars to track aircraft on the ground, in the air and to guide planes for smooth landings.
