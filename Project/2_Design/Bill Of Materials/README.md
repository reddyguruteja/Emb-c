# a) SOFTWARE :-
# 1] SimulIDE:
  - SimulIDE provides AVR, Arduino and PIC microcontrollers that can be accessed just like other components. 
  - Features like gpsim and simavr allow you to use PIC and AVR microcontrollers, respectively.
  - Editor/Debugger is still in its firsts stages of development, with basic functionalities, but it is possible to write, compile and perform basic debugging with
      breakpoints, watch registers and global variables.
      
 # 2] AVR:
   - An automatic voltage regulator (AVR) is an electronic device that maintains a constant voltage level to electrical equipment on the same load.
  - The AVR regulates voltage variations to deliver constant, reliable power supply.
  - Features:
    i] SENSING INPUT. Voltage.
    ii] POWER INPUT (PMG) Voltage.
    iii] REGULATION. +/- 1% (see note 1)
 # b) HARDWARE :
 # 1] ATmega328:
    - ATmega328 is commonly used in many projects and autonomous systems where a simple, low-powered, low-cost micro-controller is needed
  - Perhaps the most common implementation of this chip is on the popular Arduino development platform. 
  - ATMEGA328P is an 8-bit microcontroller based on AVR RISC architecture.

# 2] Sound (HC-SR04 sensor):
  - A sound sensor is defined as a module that detects sound waves through its intensity and converting it to electrical signals.
  - The HC-SR04 sensor works best between 2cm – 400 cm (1" - 13ft) within a 30 degree cone, and is accurate to the nearest 0.3cm.
  - Features:
    i] Input Voltage: 5V
    ii] Current Draw: 20mA (Max)
    iii] Digital Output: 5V
    iv] Digital Output: 0V (Low)
    v] Working Temperature:  -15°C to 70°C
    vi] Sensing Angle: 30°Cone
    vii] Angle of Effect: 15° Cone 
    viii] Ultrasonic Frequency: 40kHz
    ix] Range: 2cm - 400cm
 #  3] Display (16x2 lcd):
  - A display device is an output device for presentation of information in visual or tactile form.
  - Features:
    i] The operating voltage of this LCD is 4.7V-5.3V.
    ii] It includes two rows where each row can produce 16-characters.
    iii] The utilization of current is 1mA with no backlight.
    iv] Every character can be built with a 5×8 pixel box.
  
  # 4] Potentiometer:
  - the input impedance to be an order of magnitude (10 times) higher than the output (source) impedance.
  - Potential gradient is calculated as K = V/L, where V is the voltage across the potentiometer wire and the L is the length of the wire in the potentiometer.
  - Features:
    i] Resistance :	1K Ohm 
    ii] Potentiometer Type 	Pot Potentiometer 
    ii] Material	Carbon Film and Metal
    iv]Interface	3 Pin
    v]Shaft Length	15mm
    vi]Dimensions 	1 x 1 x 1cms 
    vii]Weight :15 grams
